# coffee_machine
A new stage in studies. Creating the system for a coffee vending machine.

I've started the course '100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023' at Udemy.

This is my first project. 

Entirely done without consultation with the current level of knowledge I have in Python. So I think it's a good indication of my current programming skills. It took me around 6 hours to assemble the whole project.
